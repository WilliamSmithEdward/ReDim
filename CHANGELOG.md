# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-25

- SelectBox: a fully drawn themed picker, because Excel fixes the native dropdown's list font
- Checkbox captions render as themed label parts that still toggle the box on click
- State persistence: `Persist`, `SetStateDefault`, and `ClearPersisted` over hidden workbook
  names, so reopened workbooks resume where the user left off
- Relative layout: `Below`, `RightOf`, and `Sized` remove coordinate arithmetic from app code
- Managed hotkeys: `HotKey` and `ClearHotKeys` with automatic release on Unmount and Shutdown
- Render now prunes orphan shapes left by renamed or removed components
- Paced jobs (`PacedMs`) for game loops and animations; Snake and Mission Control use them
- Toasts anchor to the app's content bounds, reclaim freed slots lowest-first, and always use
  surface ink in both themes
- Secondary buttons carry the theme border so they read against surface backgrounds
- The modal overlay covers from the origin to one viewport past the visible area
- Pump ticks no longer toggle ScreenUpdating, ending cursor and scroll bar flicker
- `ReDimUI.Version`
