# Changelog

## 0.2.6 - 2026-07-26

- Steadier frames: the multimedia timer resolution rises to 1 ms while the pump is armed and
  is restored on stop, so frames stop quantizing into ~15.6 ms buckets
- Frame deltas and job budgets are measured with QueryPerformanceCounter, because
  GetTickCount64 stays at the coarse system tick on modern Windows and cannot express
  sub-16 ms budgets
- Budget jobs on the default budget yield to the frame rate (8 ms per pass) while anything
  animates; explicit BudgetMs values are always honored

## 0.2.5 - 2026-07-26

- The pump runs animation frames at 16 ms (about 60 fps) while ops, budget jobs, and toast
  expiry keep their 50 ms work cadence, so smoother motion costs no extra task polling.
  Spinner rotation and toast easing are time-based, preserving their speeds at any frame
  rate, and paced jobs are sampled every frame for tighter game timing.

## 0.2.4 - 2026-07-26

- Toast stack compaction: when a toast expires or is dismissed, survivors renumber to slots
  one through N and slide up into the freed positions, and new toasts join below the live
  stack. The tray now moves like a notification tray.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-07-26

- The default toast rail clamps into the visible viewport: the rail position wins whenever it
  is on screen, and visibility wins when the window is narrower than the content or scrolled
  away. Explicit `ToastTray` pins are honored exactly.
- Toasts slide up into their slot on entrance, a pump-driven ease-out of about 300ms.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-07-26

- Toasts sit on a stable rail just outside the content's right edge, with `ToastTray` to pin
  the rail to a range; modal chrome no longer shifts toast placement
- The spinner is a block arc, a ring concentric with its box, so rotation is circular instead
  of the wobbling stroke a plain arc produces; stale arc shapes are rebuilt on adoption
- `BindEnabled` and `BindVisible` take an invert flag; Mission Control's launch button now
  disables while any feed runs

## 0.2.1 - 2026-07-26

- The pump pins `Application.Cursor` while armed and restores it on stop, ending the rapid
  busy-cursor strobe Excel produces when VBA executes at pump frequency
- Every framework shape carries the dispatcher `OnAction`, so plain clicks can no longer
  select and drag modal cards, labels, or other chrome; Ctrl+click remains for design work
- Geometry diffs against the live shape instead of a cache, so manually moved shapes snap
  back to their declared rectangles on the next render
- `FlushDirty` no longer re-assigns `ScreenUpdating` it never changed

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-25

- SelectBox: a fully drawn themed picker, because Excel fixes the native dropdown's list font
- Checkbox captions render as themed label parts that still toggle the box on click
- State persistence: `Persist`, `SetStateDefault`, and `ClearPersisted` over hidden workbook
  names, so reopened workbooks resume where the user left off
- Relative layout: `Below`, `RightOf`, and `Sized` remove coordinate arithmetic from app code
- Managed hotkeys: `HotKey` and `ClearHotKeys` with automatic release on Unmount and Shutdown
- Render now prunes orphan shapes left by renamed or removed components
- Paced jobs (`PacedMs`) for game loops and animations; Snake and Mission Control use them
- Toasts anchor to the app's content bounds, reclaim freed slots lowest-first, and always use
  surface ink in both themes
- Secondary buttons carry the theme border so they read against surface backgrounds
- The modal overlay covers from the origin to one viewport past the visible area
- Pump ticks no longer toggle ScreenUpdating, ending cursor and scroll bar flicker
- `ReDimUI.Version`

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-25

- Initial framework: role-tagged `ReDimUI.cls` runtime plus `ReDimHost.bas` host module
- Retained components over worksheet shapes with diffed rendering and idempotent mounts
- State store with text, value, visibility, and enabled bindings
- SetTimer pump stepping ROneCOne tasks without blocking waits; async ops with disable,
  spinner, done, fail, and cancel wiring; budget jobs; cancellation tokens
- Widgets: Button, Label, Card, ProgressBar, Spinner, Toggle, Checkbox, Dropdown, Slider,
  cell-backed TextInput, Toast, shapes-based modal
- Light and dark themes
- Build pipeline over pyOpenVBA, static gate over pyvbaanalysis, live suite over pyvbaharness
  with a real-compiler compile gate
- Demos: Mission Control, Widget Gallery, Snake
